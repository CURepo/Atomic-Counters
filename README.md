# Atomic-Counters

## This system verilog design interfaces a 64-bit counter with a 32-bit bus.
## Also it makes sure that the value read from the counter is _single copy atomic_.


### _The question for this coding problem is a part of quicksilicon's RTL design course._
### _The design choices in the solution is inspired from quick-silicon's video solution for the problem._
